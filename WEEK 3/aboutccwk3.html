				<li><h4>My fluffy white puppy</h4></li> 
					<p>Being a descendant of European royalty (see article linked to on homepage picture!), it's not surprising that my dog is small, a tinge vicious, and occasionally smelly. The American Kennel Association reports that the Bichon Frise's disposition is "merry"; however, I would argue that BooBoo's most promiment personality trait is "extreme fiestiness."</p>
				<li><h4>Ozone House!</h4></li>
					<p>Ozone House helps young people live safe, healthy, and productive lives.  We've been non-profiting in the Ann Arbor area since 1969, helping homeless, at-risk, and runaway youth.</p>
				<li><h4>My attempts to be a domestic goddess</h4></li>
					<p>I've recently discovered a love for baking cupcakes.  I'm still a feminist, now I'm just a feminist who makes a bada&$ meringue.</p> 
				<li><h4>The computing goddess herself - Ada Lovelace</h4></li>
					<p>Ada Lovelace is a computer programming pioneer, and a strong contender for my 2016 Halloween costume.</p>
